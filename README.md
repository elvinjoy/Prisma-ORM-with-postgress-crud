# Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL CRUD API

A basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API built with Node.js, Express, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a simple RESTful API for managing users using Node.js and Express as the server framework, Prisma ORM as the database toolkit, and PostgreSQL as the database system.

The API supports the following operations on users:

- Get all users
- Create a new user
- Get a user by ID
- Update a user by ID
- Delete a user by ID

Prisma ORM makes database interactions easy and type-safe with minimal code.
